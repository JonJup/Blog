```{r eval = F}
install.packages("DataExplorer")
library(DataExplorer)
data = readRDS("collected_site_scores.RDS")
```

```{r echo=F}
library(DataExplorer)
data = readRDS("~/01_Uni/02_getreal/002_working_package_02/001_community_data/001_individual_data_sets/001_ld/diathor/collected_site_scores.RDS")
library(magrittr)
data = data[,1:6]
data[sample(1:nrow(data),100), epid := NA]
data$habitat = sample(c("wetland", "large river", "stream", "lake", "lake outlet"), nrow(data), replace = T)
data$habitat %<>% factor
```

This weeks package is similar to last weeks. 
Just like **xray**,  **DataExplorer** is used for exploratory data analysis. 
To highlight the features and capabilities of the package we will use a data set of different diatom
metrics derived from a large data set of diatoms, which I
unfortunately am not able to share with you. 
These metrics were computed with the **diaThor**  package, which I will cover in a later post.

# How do my data look?

Assume you just got this data set and now you want to get a feeling for
it. Your initial questions might be: Are there any missing data?

```{r}
plot_missing(data)
```

Indeed, 100 rows in [epid]{style="color:CornflowerBlue"} are missing which consitutes 4.4% if the rows. 
What about our categorical variables. How are they distributed? 
```{r}
plot_bar(data)
```
Note that I did not have to tell the function which variables are categorical. 
As long as they are formatted as a factor, the function will pick them out itself. 
Of course, we also want to know how the continuous variables are distributed, which we can find out with `plot_histogram()`.
```{r}
plot_histogram(data)
```

# Relationships between variables

Now we have a basic understanding of all the variables we can start to look at relationships.
All metrics except for richness are diatom indices. 
This is not the place to go into details but diatoms are great as bioindicators, i.e. to judge the state of a waterbody. 
There are many different species (according to xxx about 200 new species are described each year) and many of them are sensitive to environmental conditions. 
These indices (EPID, IPS, TDI, SPEAR) are different ways to achive this goal. They focus on somewhat different aspects of the environment. 
Actually SPEAR is distinct from the others, it gives the relative richness of species that are sensitive to pesticides and was originally developed for invertebrates. 
XXX applied the approach to diatoms. 
Anyhow, are these metrics dependend on the species richness? 
```{r}
plot_boxplot(data, by = "richness")
```
No actually it does not look like it. 
As alternative to the boxplot, we could also have looked at scatter plots 
Because the data set is quite large (2285 observations) we will only look at a subset of 100 rows ([sampled_rows]{style="color:CornflowerBlue"})
```{r}
 plot_scatterplot(dplyr::select(data,!gr_sample_id) , by = "richness", sampled_rows = 100)
```

In practice we should either plot all data, or repeat the step above several times to ensure that the random selection of sites does not impact verdict. 
However in this case there does not seem to be any correlation between species richness and any of the diatom metrics. 

As a last step we can look at the correlation plot for the variables. 

```{r}
plot_correlation(data)
```

# For the lazy data explorer 

Another nice feature is the `create_report()` function which allows you to kick back for a moment while the function automatically runs several of the functions above as well as QQ-Plots and a PCA on the data set and compiles a HTML document with all of them. 

```{r eval=TRUE}
create_report(data)
```
