For the longest time, when you wanted to manipulate raster files in R, the raster package was your tool of choice.
And it still is a well-proven and tested alternative to the newer packages, one of which we will discuss today: terra.

# Basic idea

terra implements two new object classes: SpatRaster and SpatVector.
It is written and maintained by Robert Hijmans who also did so for the raster package.
In that sense you can think of terra as the sequel to raster.
Why did Robert Hijmans decide we need a new package?
Well the problem of creating a widely used R package is that other packages start to use it and depend on it working they way it did when that package was written.
So even if you don't like certain aspects of you package anymore, you can't just go ahead and rewrite them.
Robert Hijmans thinks that raster has grown to be unnecessarily complex with over 200 functions.
Its also slower than it could be and doesn't support HDF5 files, which is a popular format for satellite data complex.
So now terra is faster, simpler (functions have been streamlined) and more capable.
However, when you know raster, you also know how to do most things in terra.

# Creating a new Raster

The easiest way to specify a new raster is by calling `rast()` without any arguments.

```{r}
# loading the package 
library(terra)
library(dplyr)
(x <- rast())

```

As you can see, the new object covers the whole earth and is projected using a longitude and latitude on a WGS84 globe.
The resolution is 1 by 1 which means each cell covers 1 degree of latitude and one degree of longitude.
Of course we can also specify the extend and resolution of the rasters we create.

The following, raster for example, only covers the southern hemisphere.

```{r}
(x = rast(ymax = 0))
```

As you can see this also automatically altered the resolution to 0.5.
We cut the area in half so the resolution that corresponds to the direction is also cut in half.
By explicitly setting the resolution we can keep this from happening.

```{r}
x = rast(ymax = 0, res = c(1,1))
```

Alternatively we can also specify the number of rows and cells we want our raster to have.

```{r}
x = rast(nrow = 180, ncol = 360)
```

You can check the resolution of a raster with the `res()` function.
The function can also be used to compare the resolution of two (or more) rasters.

```{r}
y = rast()
all(res(x) == res(y))
```

We can also `res()` to change the resolution of a raster after creating or loading it.

```{r}
res(y) = 10
y
res(y) = c(10,100)
y
```

The last thing we have not altered about this raster skeleton, is its coordinate reference system.
If you only have a epsg code for you desired CRS check out this [website](https://epsg.io/).
It provides you with the corresponding PROJ.4 string.

```{r}
x = rast()
crs(x)
# set to WGS 84
crs(x) <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs "
# set to UTM 48
crs(x) <- "+proj=utm +zone=48 +datum=WGS84"
x
```

# Going beyond the hull

We can now create an empty raster anywhere on the world.
As long as no values are in the cells this doesn't get us anywhere however.
About time we introduce some values.

```{r}
r <- rast(ncol=10, nrow=10)
# number of cells (ncol * nrow)
ncell(r)
# do we have any values yet? 
hasValues(r)
# now we fill the raster with increasing numbers, staring with 1 
values(r) <- 1:ncell(r)
plot(r, main='Raster with 100 cells')
```

Let's have a look at two actual raster file from my harddrive.

```{r}
file1 <- here::here("data/terra/DGM25_2905530.xyz")
file2 <- here::here("data/terra/DGM25_2905540.xyz")
dem1 <- rast(file1)
dem2 <- rast(file2)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(dem1)
plot(dem2)
crs(dem1) = "+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs "
crs(dem2) = "+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs "
```

As you can see they are two digital elevation models.

```{r}
dem1
```

# Multiple layers in one SpatRaster

One SpatRaster can have multiple raster layers.
Think of the temperature in the same area in several years where each layer is one year.
Let's simulate such an example.

```{r}
# First we create a raster with temperatures between 10 and 15 degrees
r1 = rast(nrow = 25, ncol = 25)
values(r1) = runif(n = 25^2, min = 10, max = 15)
plot(r1)
# Now we create two rasters that are based on r1 but slightly warmer. 
r2 = r1 + 1
r3 = r2 + 1
```

We can combine the three rasters into one multi-layer object.
With terra this is as easy as writing a simple vector

```{r}
s <- c(r1, r2, r3)
s
```

Note that the class of a multi-layer object is the same as a single layer raster.

```{r}
class(s)
```

Calling the generic plot function on such a multi-layer raster plots all layers, so be care full with this if you have many layers!

```{r}
plot(s)
```

We can subset the object like a list.

```{r}
s[[1]]
```

# Raster algebra

SpatRaster objects can be passed to most algebraic operations in R such as `+` and `-` or `sum()` and `abs()`.
You have just seen this above, when I added a degree of temperature to our simulated temperature rasters.
Below are some more examples

```{r}
p = r1 + 4
o = sqrt(r1)
x = sum(values(r))
```

You can also add, substract, multiply and divide rasters with each other.

```{r}
xo = x + o 
ox = x + o
px = p / x
```

# High-level functions

In most situations you will have rasters that are larger than what you need.
You might be interested in the landcover of your study area but the data covers all of Europe.
Conversely, you might also need to combine different rasters if the scale of your analysis is larger than the data you are using.
Often this is the case when larger rasters are split in smaller areas to reduce their size.

In the first case you would use `crop()`.
Provided with a raster and an extend, `crop()` will return only the part of the raster that lies within the extend.
An extend usually is a named vector with four elements: xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax.
It might for example be the bounding box you derived from the vector data you were analyzing in sf.
You can create this raster yourself if you know, or can derive, the relevant numbers.
An alternative is the `drawExtent()` function from the raster package.
This lets you click on an already plotted raster an returns the extend of the thus created rectangle.
Try the code below in your own R instance to see what I mean.

```{r eval = F}
plot(dem1)
extent = raster::drawExtent()
dem1crop = terra::crop(x =dem1, y=extent)
```

```{r echo = F}
plot(dem1)
extent = readRDS(here::here("data/terra/extent.RDS"))
dem1crop = terra::crop(x =dem1, y=extent)
plot(dem1crop)
```

Nice!
Now have reduced the raster to the area we are actually interested in.
We can compute the mean hight or the sum of all hights with `global()`.

```{r}
global(dem1crop, "sum")
global(dem1crop, "mean")
```

We can also expand a raster.
That means we add rows and/ or columns with NA values.
The other way around we can also trim them, removing all cells with NAs in the margins.

```{r}
dem1.exp = expand(dem1, y = c(100,100))
plot(dem1.exp)
```

Since all the NAs are just white its hard to see what we actually did here.
Lets give them some random value so we can actually see the cells we added.

```{r}
na_cells = which(is.na(values(dem1.exp)))
values(dem1.exp)[na_cells] = 1
plot(dem1.exp)
```

We can now clearly see the added cells in gray.
With `trim()` we can remove them again.

```{r}
na_cells = which(values(dem1.exp) == 1)
values(dem1.exp)[na_cells] = NA
dem1.trm = trim(dem1.exp)
plot(dem1.trm)
```

As mentioned before, sometimes you want to combine rasters.
For example our to dems are both part of a larger DEM that covers all of German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
We can combine the two with `merge()`

```{r}
dem_merge = merge(dem1, dem2)
plot(dem_merge)
```

Whenever you want to use multiple raster in an operation, it is important that they have the same CRS and cell sizes.
You can increase cell sizes with `aggregate()` and reduce cell sizes with `disaggregate()`.
In the first case several cells are combined into one.
The number of cells is set in the fact argument.
When you supply one number it is used for both directions.
So if you call `aggregate(x, fact = 2)` and raster has the cell size 10m by 10m, the new raster will be 20m by 20m.
You can also provide fact with a vector that specifies the aggregation factor in each direction.
The third argument is fun which specifies how to calculate the new cell value.
If our new cell consists out of four old cells (aggregation factor of 2) we somehow need to combine these four numbers into one.
Common options here are mean, median, modal, maximum, minimum or sum.

```{r}
dem1_agg_2_mean = aggregate(dem1, fact=2, fun = "mean")
dem1_agg_3_mean = aggregate(dem1, fact=4, fun = "mean")
dem1_agg_4_mean = aggregate(dem1, fact=6, fun = "mean")
dem1_agg_5_mean = aggregate(dem1, fact=8, fun = "mean")
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(dem1_agg_2_mean)
plot(dem1_agg_3_mean)
plot(dem1_agg_4_mean)
plot(dem1_agg_5_mean)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
dem1_agg_mean = aggregate(dem1, fact = c(1,6), fun = "mean")
dem1_agg_min = aggregate(dem1, fact = 4, fun = "min")
dem1_agg_max = aggregate(dem1, fact = 4, fun = "max")
dem1_agg_sum = aggregate(dem1, fact = 4, fun = "sum")
plot(dem1_agg_mean,  main = "directed aggregation")
plot(dem1_agg_min,   main = "minimum")
plot(dem1_agg_max,   main = "maximum")
plot(dem1_agg_sum , main = "sum")
```

When we want to go in the other direction we disaggregate raster cells.
Sadly, we cannot magically determine what values are the field truth for the new, smaller cells.
Instead each new cell gets the same value as it's parent.

```{r}
dem1_disagg = disaggregate(dem1, fact = 2)
plot(dem1_disagg)
```

Both `aggregate()` and `disaggregate()` can only take integer values as (dis)aggregation factors.
So what do you do if the new cell size you need as not simple multiple of the old one?
We use `resample()`.
To highlight how this works we will create a new raster which covers the same area and has a cell size of 15 by 15 meters.

```{r}
x = rast(resolution = c(15,15), crs = "+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs ",
         extent = ext(dem1))
x2 = resample(x = dem1, y = x)
plot(x2)
```

Changing the CRS, i.e. what we know as transforming for vectors is called wrapping for rasters and can be done with the aptly named function `wrap()`.

## Masking

Sometimes we might want to fill holes in rasters, i.e. areas that only contain NAs or some other non-informative value, with the values from a second raster.
This operation is called masking.
Here we will work through a short example, where there are randomly scatted NAs throughout the raster.
This might happen if small but thick clouds prevented our satellite to accurately measure conditions on the ground.

```{r}
# Example1 
dem1_na = dem1 
values(dem1_na)[sample(1:ncell(dem1), size = 100)] = NA
#to increase the visibility of the masked cells we will create a separate mask layer with extreme values. 
dem1_mask = dem1
values(dem1_mask) = 1000
dem1_nax = cover(x = dem1_na, y = dem1_mask)
plot(dem1_nax)
```

The `lapp()` function is used for functional programming. It is similar to `apply()`-family functions or `map`-family functions from the *purrr* package. 
It applies a function to each layer of a raster 
Here for example we increase the height of a third of the cells by 10m.

```{r}
dem1_2 = dem1_3 = dem1
values(dem1_2) = rbinom(ncell(dem1),1,0.33)
values(dem1_3) = 10
dem1_all = c(dem1, dem1_2, dem1_3)
dem_lapp = lapp(dem1_all, function(x,y,z) x + y * z)
plot(dem_lapp)
```

We can classify the cells with the `classify()` function. 

```{r}
m <- c(0, 100, 1,
       100, 250, 2,
       250, 400, 3,
       400, 600, 4)
dem1_cut = classify(dem1, rcl = m)
plot(dem1_cut)
```

`focal()` can be used to replace the value of a focal cell by some function of its neighbours. Which neighbours and what function to use can be chosen as arguments. 

```{r}
mw = focal(dem1, w=3)
plot(mw)
```

# Cell-level functions

In terra the cells within a raster a numbered from the upper left cell to the upper right and then continuing in the second row.
See the first plot in **Going beyond the hull**.
There is bunch of functions to help you figure out the values of specific cells:

```{r, eval = F}
# how many columns
ncol(r)
# how many rows
nrow(r)
# how many cells 
ncell(r)
# in which row is cell 3?
rowFromCell(dem1, 3)
# in which column is cell 3?
colFromCell(dem1, 3)
# which cell is in row 5 and column 5?
cellFromRowCol(dem1,5,5)
# what are the coordinates of cell 100? 
xyFromCell(dem1, 100)
# which cell lies at the coordinates 0,0 
cellFromXY(r, cbind(0,0))
# which column has a Y coordinate of 0 
colFromX(r, 0)
# which row has a Y coordinate of 0 
rowFromY(r, 0)
```

We have seen before that we can use `values()` to alter or extract the cell values of a raster to a vector.
As alternatives we can use `valuesBlock()` to read a rectangle of blocks or `extract()` to get the cell values in a specific area.

```{r}
cells <- cellFromRowCol(dem1, 50, 35:39)
xy <- xyFromCell(dem1, cells)
extract(dem1, xy)
```

This wraps up our quick first peek at the *terra* package.
However there are many more things one can do with the package which we might cover in a later post.
