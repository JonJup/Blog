```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(corrr, vegan, tidyverse)
```

This week we will have a look at the `corrr` package. 
It includes some nice possibilities to visualize correlations between mutliple variables. 
I will provide some examples using the varechem data set from the `vegan` package. 

First, load the data and have a look at them. 
```{r}
data(varechem)
head(varechem) |> knitr::kable()
```
As you can see, the data set contains different soil parameters like Nitrogen, Phosphorus or depth of the humus layer. 
The basic function of the `corrr` package is `correlate()`, which works similar to base R's `cor()`. 

```{r}
corrr_table <- correlate(varechem, quiet = TRUE)
```

The main difference between `cor()` and `correlate()` is that the latter returns a tibble while the former returns a matrix. 
In the call above, I set the **quiet** argument to `TRUE`. 
This prevents the function from returning information on the correlation metric and the method of dealing with missing values. 
Both options can be set explicitly with the **method** and **use** arguments. 
Here, I used their default values (pearson correlation and only using pairwise complete observations).

The package uses a tibble instead of a matrix so the we can make use of all the tidyverse functions, like 
only showing terms with a correlation above 0.7 with zinc ... 
```{r}
corrr_table |> filter(Zn >  0.7) |> pull(term)
```
... or only showing correlations of nirogen and sulphur ... 
```{r}
corrr_table |> select(N, S)
```
... or asking what the mean correlation of nitrogen and sulfur to all other variables is. 
```{r}
corrr_table |> 
  select(N,S) |> 
  map_dbl(~mean(., na.rm = T))
```
There are also some new data wrangling functions that `corrr` introduces.
`shave()` sets the lower or upper triangle to NA. 
```{r}
shave(corrr_table, upper = TRUE)
```
We can rearrange the columns so that highly correlated columns are next to one another with `rearrange()`, which I will show below when we come to plots, because this is only relevant for plotting.  
The `focus()` function is very similar to `select()`. The only difference is that the the **term** column is automatically selected in the `focus()` functions. 
```{r}
focus(corrr_table, N) |> 
  head()
```

The last in the bunch is `fashion()` which can be used to create a nice looking version of the table: no leading zeros, NAs are replace by empty cells 
```{r}
fashion(corrr_table) |> knitr::kable()
```

While all these things are nice the really cool thing about `corrr` is the plots: 

```{r}
corrr_table |> 
  rearrange() |> 
  rplot()
```

and 

```{r}
corrr_table |> 
  network_plot()
```

In the network plot highly correlated variables appear closer together and are joined by stronger (darker) paths. 
The function includes an argument to exclude correlations below some threshold (`min_cor`), to change the color scale (`colours`), and lastly and a argument for whether arrows should be straight or curved (`curved`). 
So we could modify the above plot to this: 

```{r}
corrr_table |> 
  network_plot(
          min_cor = 0.5,
          colours = c("green", "black", "blue"),
          curved = FALSE
  )
```

Yes, the first one was prettier but now you know what you can do with this.
